# Why We Vax

Understanding why people choose to vaccinate or not is essential for pandemic preparedness. Vaccine hesitancy stems from a mix of practical barriers and deeply held beliefs, values, and social influences. Our project builds a framework for targeted, equitable vaccination strategies that respect personal values while protecting public health.

By combining behavioral research with advanced data modeling, we aim to better understand vaccination uptake and support more effective, person-centered interventions.

### Objectives:
1. **Identify vaccination decision profiles** using a national survey linked to CBS microdata.  
2. **Map these profiles locally** across the Netherlands to estimate their regional distribution.  
3. **Model vaccination preparedness** by analyzing how beliefs and behaviors spread through social networks.
